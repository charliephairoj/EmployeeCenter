Since manufacturers of upholstery fabrics do not warranty against shrinkage, stretching, color
fastness, wearability or adverse reaction to stain repellent treatments, we are unable to
consider adjustments, claims, or credits for fabrics.
As all fabrics have varying characteristics and can stretch (creating puddling) and or show
surface wear (creating piling, etc). Dellarobbia is not responsible for claims regarding fabric
wear & tear, as it is subject to specific use and or environment. It is the responsibility of the
sales / design professional and/or consumer to select fabric appropriate to the intended usage
and environment.

If fabric treatment is desired, it is recommended that covers be removed from any feather and
down cushions prior to treatment and allowed to dry thoroughly before being reapplied.
Dellarobbia cannot be held accountable for any problems relating to moisture induced odor and
discoloration. Odor occurs when moisture is trapped between the cover and cushion fill.
Some fabrics have a natural tendency to shade with either light changes or angles. This is
inherent with many quality fabrics and should not be considered abnormal.

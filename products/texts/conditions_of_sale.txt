All orders from manufacturerâ€™s representatives and customers are accepted and validated once
the acknowledgment has been issued from Dellarobbia. Orders are finalized in our office and
not by our factory representatives. Clerical errors are subject to correction. Pricing terms and
specifications are subject to change without notice. If prices are increased without notice, the
customer may have the option to cancel or accept their merchandise at the new price at the
time the order is acknowledged.

Wherever it is possible to make an item longer, there will be an upcharge of 10% for the first 15cm
and an additional charge of 1% for every 5cm thereafter. To make an item shorter in length,
add a 10% upcharge. Some models cannot be modified. Please verify all modifications with
the factory. Up charges are for one direction only! Please note frame height and depth can not
be modified.

Due to the “soft” nature of upholstered furniture, even scale drawings are, at best,
approximations. If exact dimensions are critical in your application, please include this
information with your order. If this information is not included, Dellarobbia cannot be
responsible for slight variations from printed dimensions, scale drawings or actual goods.
